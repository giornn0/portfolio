                <p>
                  I'm a self-taught web developer. I work mainly with Angular, Next.js, Nodejs, Laravel but lately focusing on Rust<br/>
                  I started my programming journey with Python, which I've come upon with it whilst I was studying Chemical Engineering at university. After I dropped out because of personal issues, I kept going on my own learning everything I could about programming, languages and data structures.<br/>
                  In addition, I'm really passionate about web developing, music, anime and games.
